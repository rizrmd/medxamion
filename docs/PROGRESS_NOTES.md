# Exam System Migration - Progress Notes

## Project Overview
Migrating legacy Laravel exam system (ionbec-exam) to modern TypeScript/React architecture using the existing codebase structure.

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning ✅
**Date: 2025-08-02**

1. **Analyzed Legacy System**
   - Explored ionbec-exam Laravel directory structure
   - Examined database models and relationships
   - Reviewed Vue.js components and Inertia.js patterns
   - Identified key features and business logic

2. **Created Architecture Mapping**
   - Documented in `docs/ARCHITECTURE_MAPPING.md`
   - Mapped Laravel controllers → TypeScript APIs
   - Mapped Eloquent models → Prisma schema
   - Mapped Vue components → React components
   - Defined migration strategy and priorities

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure ✅
**Date: 2025-08-02**

1. **Database Schema**
   - Verified existing Prisma schema includes all exam-related tables
   - Tables: exams, items, questions, answers, categories, groups, takers, deliveries, attempts
   - Maintained all relationships from Laravel models

2. **Type Definitions**
   - Created `shared/types/exam.ts` with comprehensive types:
     - ExamWithRelations, ItemWithRelations, QuestionWithRelations
     - DeliveryWithRelations, GroupWithRelations, TakerWithRelations
     - AttemptWithRelations, ScoringTypes
     - Request/Response types for APIs

3. **API Implementation**
   - **Exam Management APIs** (`backend/src/api/exam/`)
     - exam.ts - Exam CRUD with options support
     - item.ts - Question sets/vignettes with category linking
     - question.ts - Questions with answer creation
     - answer.ts - Answer options management
     - category.ts - Question categorization
   
   - **Delivery Management APIs** (`backend/src/api/delivery/`)
     - delivery.ts - Test session scheduling with token generation
     - group.ts - Test taker group management with auto-code generation
     - taker.ts - Test taker CRUD with password hashing and group assignment
   
   - **Attempt & Scoring APIs** (`backend/src/api/attempt/`, `backend/src/api/scoring/`)
     - start.ts - Initialize exam attempt with validation
     - submit-answer.ts - Real-time answer submission with progress tracking
     - finish.ts - Complete attempt
     - item-answers.ts - Retrieve answers for specific items
     - auto-mcq.ts - Automatic MCQ scoring
     - summary.ts - Scoring dashboard data

4. **State Management**
   - Created `frontend/src/lib/states/exam-state.ts`
   - Manages exam session, navigation, answers, timer
   - Tracks question status (skipped, later, completed)
   - Persists state to localStorage for recovery

## Current Status

### What's Working:
- ✅ Complete API structure for exam system
- ✅ Type-safe interfaces for all entities
- ✅ CRUD operations for all core models
- ✅ Authentication integration ready (using better-auth)
- ✅ State management for exam-taking flow
- ✅ Database schema fully migrated
- ✅ Admin pages for exam management
- ✅ Admin pages for delivery scheduling

### What's Pending:
- ⏳ Group management pages
- ⏳ Exam taking interface
- ⏳ WebSocket implementation for live features
- ⏳ PDF generation for results
- ⏳ Email notifications
- ⏳ File upload for attachments
- ⏳ Import/export functionality

## Technical Decisions

1. **API Pattern**: Using standardized CRUD handler from rlib
2. **State Management**: Valtio for reactive state (following project conventions)
3. **Authentication**: Leveraging existing better-auth setup with multi-user type support
4. **Database**: Raw SQL queries for complex relations marked with @ignore in Prisma
5. **Routing**: Will use existing router library (not React Router)

## Known Issues & Solutions

1. **Prisma @ignore Relations**
   - Issue: Many-to-many tables marked with @ignore
   - Solution: Using raw SQL queries for operations like token generation

2. **TypeScript Path Aliases**
   - Issue: Backend tsconfig didn't include @/* alias
   - Solution: Added "@/*": ["./src/*"] to paths

3. **CRUD Handler Interface**
   - Issue: Tried to use 'transform' property
   - Solution: Use 'before' hook for data transformation

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Admin Interface
1. Create exam list page with CRUD operations
2. Build question bank interface with categories
3. Implement delivery scheduling UI
4. Add group and taker management pages

### Priority 2: Exam Taking Interface
1. Build waiting room component
2. Create main exam interface with timer
3. Implement question navigation
4. Add answer submission UI

### Priority 3: Advanced Features
1. Manual scoring interface for essays
2. Result generation and PDF export
3. Live interview support with WebSocket
4. Analytics dashboard

## Migration Notes

### Key Differences from Laravel:
1. **Authentication**: Laravel Fortify → better-auth with custom taker auth
2. **Real-time**: Laravel Echo/Pusher → Custom WebSocket implementation
3. **File Storage**: Laravel Storage → Direct file system with path management
4. **Jobs/Queues**: Laravel Jobs → Direct async functions (consider adding queue later)
5. **Validation**: Laravel Requests → TypeScript types + runtime validation

### Data Migration Strategy:
1. Database already migrated via Prisma pull
2. User passwords will need rehashing during first login
3. File attachments need path updates
4. Maintain backward compatibility for tokens

## Performance Considerations

1. **Large Exams**: Lazy load questions to handle exams with 100+ questions
2. **Concurrent Users**: Consider Redis for session management
3. **File Uploads**: Implement chunked uploads for large attachments
4. **Scoring Jobs**: May need queue system for bulk scoring operations

## Security Notes

1. **Token Generation**: Using crypto-random 8-character tokens
2. **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with cost factor 10
3. **Session Management**: Leveraging better-auth's secure session handling
4. **Input Validation**: TypeScript types + runtime checks
5. **SQL Injection**: Using Prisma parameterized queries

## Dependencies Added

- bcryptjs (^3.0.2) - Password hashing
- @types/bcryptjs (^3.0.0) - TypeScript types

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Need to create tests for scoring algorithms
2. **Integration Tests**: Test full exam flow from start to finish
3. **Load Tests**: Simulate 100+ concurrent test takers
4. **Security Tests**: Token validation, SQL injection attempts

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Need DATABASE_URL, AUTH_SECRET
2. **File Permissions**: Ensure upload directories are writable
3. **Database Migrations**: Run Prisma migrations before deployment
4. **Static Assets**: Configure CDN for exam attachments
